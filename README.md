# UFO Sightings
## Project Overview:

For this project, we were required to enhance Dana’s webpage on UFO sightings by using Javascript to create a dynamic table where a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings would enable end-users to filter for multiple criteria simultaneously. 



## Results:
This search tool can be a good resource for anyone seeking to get UFO sighting information for selected states, cities, and more.

You don’t need to be an expert or an UFO enthusiast to navigate through Dana’s UFO website. All you need is a sense of curiosity.

Let’s get started…


### ONE. **UFO FINDER LANDING PAGE**
The UFO webpage includes a short article and a dynamic data table with all the UFO sighting information pulled from the Javascript data file.

The Truth is Out There:

### TWO. **FILTER SEARCH**
To perform a search, on the Landing Page go to the ‘Filter Search’ section in the lower-left corner of the page.  A column of criteria fields will be listed for users to utilize for custom search operations.  After one or more fields are filled, select the “click” button at the bottom to run the search. 



Filter Search:

### THREE. **SEARCH OUTPUT**
In this example, a search for the City of San Diego, CA is performed (yellow-outlined).  Behind the scene, the javascipt and html files created will run through the written codes to display the results within the data table, red-outlined. 

Criteria Search:

***Output***: There were three UFO sightings documented in San Diego, Ca during early January 2010.  People were more vigilant during this period to have witnessed these strange phenomena. 



### FOUR. **ADDITIONAL SEARCHES**
Users have the capability to perform single or multiple criteria searches by filling in the desired fields as shown below.

Example1. Single Search_UFO Shape Type:

Example2. Multiple Criteria Search_City Comparison:

## Summary:
As accurate and user-friendly this UFO search tool is, it’s only as good as the data file used. To make this program more powerful and extensive,  it’s strongly recommended to;


1.  Link to a larger data source where the dataset is maintained from an accredited institution such as NASA or JPL.

2.  Include other criteria filters to enhance searches such as a *Duration* field.

3.  Add an export feature to generate reporting capabilities in Excel, PDF or CSV format.
